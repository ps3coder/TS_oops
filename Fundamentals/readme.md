There are 6 pillars of OOPs

1. Class
2. Objects
3. Data Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism

--> Class : A class is a bluepront for creating objects that shares common properties and behaviors.It serves as a template or a prototype from which objects are created. A class encapsulates data for the objects and methods to operate on that data . It provides a way to structure and organize code in modular and reusable manner.

-->Objects : It is a basic unit of OOPs and represents the life entities. An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated(Object is created) memory is allocated. An objects has an identity , state and behaviour. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data . Objects can interact without having to know details of each others data or code it is sufficient to know thw type of message accepted and type of responce retuned by the objects

--> Abstraction : Abstraction is a concept that allows you to focus on the essential attributes and behaviour of and behaviour of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It involves representing only the relevant characterstics of an object and hidinf the complec implementaion details from the user

--> Encapsulation : Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechaniam that binds together code and the data it manipulated.In Encapsulation the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which the are declared

--> Inheritance : Inheritance in OOP is a concept where a new class(called a subclass or derived class) is created based on an existing class(called a superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and behaviours(methods) from its superclass , allowing it to reuse and extends the functionality of the superclass.
